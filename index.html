    <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
        <p>
            As one of five co-founders of startup game company Clockwork Giants, <br/>
            I have gained a plethora of experience working with people and in different roles. <br/>
            This flexibility led me to create and release Lareissa Everbright on Steam as the <br/>
            sole developer while still working on Clockwork Giant’s Introspect. Though I am <br/>
            used to a multi-faceted workload and wearing many hats, at my core I am a <br/>
            qualified programmer with professional experience working in C++ and C#. I <br/>
            have a thirst for learning new skills and wish to enter a role where I can <br/>
            further grow as a developer and apply my learnt abilities to exciting projects.
